              Sunfruit can delay enforcing its rights under these terms without losing
              them. In addition, Sunfruit&apos;s failure to exercise its rights on any one
              occasion, or even on more than one occasion, does not constitute a
              waiver of its rights for any future occasion. All waivers must be in
              writing.

              These Terms of Use and the Other Terms constitute the entire agreement
              and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the
              Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements,
              communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and
              us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of

              provision will continue to be enforceable to the extent permitted by
              that court or agency, and the remainder of that provision will no longer
              be considered as part of these terms. However, all other provisions will
              remain in full force and effect.

              claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
              of the State of North Carolina without giving effect to any choice or
              conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of North
              Carolina or any other jurisdiction) and must be brought exclusively in a
              court having jurisdiction for Raleigh, North Carolina. You consent to
              the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by Sunfruit and exclusive venue
              in such courts. Any claim brought by you in connection with the Services
              may not and will not be made the subject of a class action. To the
              fullest extent allowable by applicable law, you and Sunfruit waive the
              right to a jury trial.
